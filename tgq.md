# Abstract - Introduction

The Tesseract Graph Query Language (TGQ) is inspired by SQL{% cite coddsql %}, not in syntax but by purpose. SQL allows querying, creating, updating and deleting (CRUD) of data in a relational database {% cite coddrelational %}. TGQ serves the same purpose. While it is written for The Tesseract's [query model](/query-model.html) in particular, it is general enough to apply to other graph storage systems.
